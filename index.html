            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
                system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: federal, state and local. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
                Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
                The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in
                Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of India’s constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made
                education a ‘concurrent subject’. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
                responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with 28
                states and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in the
                policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">In the 2011 Census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81%
                for males and 65% for females. National Statistical Commission surveyed literacy to be 77.7% in 2017–18,
                84.7% for male and 70.3% for female. This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and
                29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%.India's improved education system is often cited as one of
                the main contributors to its economic development. Much of the progress, especially in higher education
                and scientific research, has been credited to various public institutions. While enrolment in higher
                education has increased steadily over the past decade, reaching a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of 26.3%
                in 2019, there still remains a significant distance to catch up with tertiary education enrolment levels
                of developed nations, a challenge that will be necessary to overcome in order to continue to reap a
                demographic dividend from India's comparatively young population.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">As per the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2012, 96.5% of all
                rural children between the ages of 6-14 were enrolled in school. This is the fourth annual survey to
                report enrolment above 96%. India has maintained an average enrolment ratio of 95% for students in this
                age group from year 2007 to 2014. As an outcome the number of students in the age group 6-14 who are not
                enrolled in school has come down to 2.8% in the academic year 2018 (ASER 2018). Another report from 2013
                stated that there were 229 million students enrolled in different accredited urban and rural schools of
                India, from Class I to XII, representing an increase of 2.3 million students over 2002 total enrolment,
                and a 19% increase in girl's enrolment. While quantitatively India is inching closer to universal
                education, the quality of its education has been questioned particularly in its government run school
                system. While more than 95 per cent of children attend primary school, just 40 per cent of Indian
                adolescents attend secondary school (Grades 9-12). Since 2000, the World Bank has committed over $2
                billion to education in India. Some of the reasons for the poor quality include absence of around 25% of
                teachers every day. States of India have introduced tests and education assessment system to identify
                and improve such schools.</p>
